Making a Traffic System using all Components such as 
• GPIOs 
• A/D Converter 
• Temperature sensor 
• Light sensor 
• PWM – Fan & speaker 
• Timer and Counters 
• System interrupts 
• TFT interface 
• I2C bus 
• SPI bus 
• RTC 
• IR Remote Control 


Integrating a design that will have the following functions: 
• A TFT panel used as a main display. 
• An ambient temperature in degree C and F is displayed on the screen 
• A digital clock shows the time and date 
• A fan support with full function control – On/Off and speed 
• An indicator of the duty cycle for the fan control 
• An alarm function is available to activate a multicolor LED when the alarm set time 
is reached 
• A remote control used to setup the actual time, the alarm time and the set temperature 
for a heater control (represented by the fan). 
• A push-button switch used to enable the Alarm function
